## Overview

In this post, we'll explore how to migrate a customized inherited process from one Azure DevOps organization to another. We'll walk you through the process using the powerful [process-migrator](https://github.com/microsoft/process-migrator) tool, developed by Microsoft.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the process migration journey with the process-migrator tool, let's make sure your environment is ready. 
To get started, you'll need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine.

1- Verify Node.js Installation

- Open your command prompt (cmd).
- Type node --version and check if Node.js is installed. If it's not installed, we'll need to proceed with the installation.

2- Download Node.js

Visit [node.js.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to download the latest LTS version, which includes npm.

3- Select Your Installer

Choose the installer that matches your machine. For example, if you're using Windows, select the Windows Installer.

4- Installation

Locate the downloaded Node.js installer and double-click it to begin the installation, as shown in the screenshot below.

5- Verification

To confirm the successful installation of Node.js, repeat Step (1) by opening your command prompt and running `node --version`. This time, you should see the installed Node.js version displayed.

## Installing process-migrator

Now that your environment is ready, install the process-migrator tool by running the following command in your command prompt (cmd):

`npm install process-migrator -g`

## Creating the configuration file

1. Navigate to the desired location where you want to create the configuration file.

2. Run the command `process-migrator`. This will generate the configuration file in the specified location.

This is how the created configuration file looks like:

## Preparing the configuration

To configure the process-migrator tool, you'll need to specify the following parameters in the configuration file:

- **sourceAccountUrl:** This is the URL of your source organization in Azure DevOps.
- **sourceAccountToken:** Your Personal Access Token (PAT) for the source organization.
- **targetAccountUrl:** This is the URL of your target organization in Azure DevOps.
- **targetAccountToken:** Your Personal Access Token (PAT) for the target organization.
- **sourceProcessName:** The name of the source process to be migrated.


1- Copy the URL of your Source Organization and paste it for sourceAccountUrl.

2- Copy the URL of your Target Organization and paste it for targetAccountUrl.

3- Create PAT for both the source and target organizations.

Here's how to set up your PAT:

**For the Source Organization:**

1- Click on your user settings and select "Personal Access Token".

2- Click `New Token`.

3- Enter the following details:

- Name

- Ensure you've selected the Source organization.

- For PAT scope, choose custom-defined, and ensure the "Work Items" permission has `Read, Write, & Manage` checked.

- Click Create

![Create PAT Step (2)](/assets/images/process-migration/9-create-pat-2.png)

3- Copy the value of the PAT, and paste it for sourceAccountToken

![Create PAT Step (3)](/assets/images/process-migration/10-create-pat-3.png)

Repeat these steps for the Target Organization to create a PAT and paste its value for targetAccountToken.

4- Go to the Source organization to copy the source process name, and then paste it for sourceProcessName.

After defining all the required parameters, your configuration file should look something like this:

![Config File](/assets/images/process-migration/12-config-after-updating-values.png)

**NOTE:** The configuration file is in `JSONC` format, which means you don't have to remove comment lines for it to work. 

## Running the Migration

You're all set to start the migration process. Simply open the command prompt (cmd) and type: 

`process-migrator`

**NOTE:** You can also specify the following switches:

- `--mode=<migrate (default)/import/export>`: Choose the migration mode.
- `--config=<your-configuration-file-path>`: Specify the path to your configuration file.

The tool will export the Source process template into a JSON file and then import it into the Target organization.

Here are the Target organization processes before and after the Migration:

**Before Migration:**

**After Migration:**

The imported JSON and log files can be located within the `Output` folder, in the same directory as your configuration file.
